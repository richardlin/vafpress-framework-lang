=======================

Multiple Languages repository for Vafpress Framework

How to contribute?

1. Download the POT template file (vafpress-framework.pot)
2. Do the translation with a PO editor program, such as [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/download.php). We use it.
3. Save your work as a .po file and .mo file (which is genereated automatically as you save it)
4. The naming convention of the files (.po and .mo) is based on the ISO-639 language code (e.g. pt for Portuguese) followed by the ISO-3166 country code (e.g. _PT for Portugal or _BR for Brazil). So, the Brazilian Portuguese file would be called pt__BR.mo, and a non-specific Portuges file would be called pt.mo. Complete lists of codes can be found at ([country codes](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Country-Codes)) and ([language codes](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Language-Codes)).
5. Then please commit both files to the /lang directory.
6. Thank you very much for your contribution!
